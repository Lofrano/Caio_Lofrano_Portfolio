# Caio Lofrano 
Grown up in Taipei, I am a Brazilian who has graduated from both a Taiwanese high school and university. 

Since my 3rd academic year I have been involved in the startup scene in Taipei, and since then I try to create meaningful connections that later can become a project. 

Back in 2018, I had Interned at Whoscall and that gave me an eye opening experience, that would further bring me into the digital world.
Now I make products and ideas come true along with team building and cooperation.
